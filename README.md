# NAME

Alt::Data::Frame::ButMore - DEPRECATED Alternative implementation of Data::Frame

# VERSION

version 0.006001

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use Data::Frame;
```

# DESCRIPTION

This distribution was originally a fork and alternative implementation of
[Data::Frame](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data%3A%3AFrame). Now with [Data::Frame](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data%3A%3AFrame) regaining maintenance, this
distribution's code has been merged into [Data::Frame](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data%3A%3AFrame). And since this
distribution's version 0.006001 now its installation simply gets
you [Data::Frame](https://metacpan.org/pod/Data%3A%3AFrame), and this distribution is kept only as a wrapper for
compatibility.
