=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Data::Frame;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This distribution was originally a fork and alternative implementation of
L<Data::Frame>. Now with L<Data::Frame> regaining maintenance, this
distribution's code has been merged into L<Data::Frame>. And since this
distribution's version 0.006001 now its installation simply gets
you L<Data::Frame>, and this distribution is kept only as a wrapper for
compatibility.
